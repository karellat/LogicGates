# LogicGates
Logic gates simple simulation with console input user interface

As a term project for programming in c++

Supports: 

    * basic logic gates:
        * NOT
        * AND 
        * OR 
        * XOR
        * NAND
        * NOR
        * XNOR
        
    * other gates
        * Input
        * Output
        * Blank
        * ConstIn
    
    * User defined gates
        * gates made of basic or builded gates
        * matrix resolving
        * simulating of intern gate 
        
     
        
    * workbench:
        * different states 
        
            * creating new circuit(UnderConstruction)
                * add gate
                * connect gates
                * add input gates(the final input for the binary number)
                * add output gates(the final output number) 
                * use constructed 
                
            * calculation logic function for binnary input(Constructed)
                * set input (Calculating)
                * read output (Calculated)
                * construct the gate from actual bench
                
    * workbench text user interface: 
        * support text control of the bench 
        * log or standard output methods
        * parse input
