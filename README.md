# LogicGates
Logic gates simple simulation with console input user interface

As a term project for programming in c++

Consists of: 
##Graph 
* general simple multigraph
    * adding verteces, edges with arbitary values
    * cycle test
    * accessbillity test 
##Gates
* basic logic gates:
    * NOT
    * AND 
    * OR 
    * XOR
    * NAND
    * NOR
    * XNOR
        
* other gates
    * Input
    * Output
    * Blank
    * ConstIn0
    * ConstIn1
    * Double
    
* User defined gates
    * gates made of basic or reusing user defined gates
    * simulating of intern gate      
        
##workbench: 
* creating new circuit(UnderConstruction)
    * add gate
    * connect gates
    * add input gates(the final input for the binary number)
    * add output gates(the final output number) 
    * use constructed 
                
 * calculation logic function for binnary input(Constructed)
     * set input (Calculating)
     * read output (Calculated)
     * construct the gate from actual bench
                
##workbenchTUI
*  reading gates from file (file format: example.txt)
*  set inputs to constructed gates
